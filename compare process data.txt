'is there a way to find what sort of requests does a flash application send to a server?i was trying to see what information a client sends to the server using chrome inspect element, but it shows me that nothing is going on.but for sure the communication is going on. the website i am interesting in is  and every time you make a move it somehow sends it to a server or may be just to another opponent. in the end of the game - it sends the game to the server for sure. but up till now, all i can see is just few images, being uploaded during the game.thanks for help.p.s. i was trying to use wireshark to capture packets and in such a way to see the communication. here what i was doing:pinging chesscube.com to realize its ip-address: 78.47.2.115than i am listening only for a packages from that ip address ip.addr == 78.47.2.115but the only thing i can see is a lot of tcp and some http packages. all http packages are sending just png images of the avatars of the users. there is a chat there, and people are constantly speaking but i can no see that. i understand that it is going from another ip address, but i have no idea how i can found out it. the problem is that i can not watch for all traffic between the net and my computer, because there is so much of it, and i do not know how limit it.'
